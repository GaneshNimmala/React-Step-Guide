# React Learning Project - Steps.

Welcome to my React learning project! This project was created while I was learning React through an online course. It serves as a practical demonstration of the concepts and skills I acquired during the course. Below, you'll find code snippets and explanations for various React concepts implemented in this project.

## Concepts Showcase

### Functional Components

In React, functional components are a core building block. Here's an example of a functional component definition:

        import { useState } from "react";

        function Steps() {
        const [step, setStep] = useState(1);
        // ...
        }

### State Management with `useState`

The `useState` hook is used to manage component state. Here's an example of using `useState` to manage the `step` and `isOpen` state variables:

        const [step, setStep] = useState(1);
        const [isOpen, setOpenClose] = useState(true);

### Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering is a crucial concept. Elements are conditionally displayed based on certain conditions, such as the `isOpen` state variable:

    {
    isOpen && <div className="steps">{/* ... */}</div>;
    }

### Props and Component Composition

Props are used to pass data to child components. Here's an example of passing props to the `StepMessage` component:

    function StepMessage({ step, children }) {
    // ...
    }

### Event Handling

Event handling is implemented to respond to user interactions. For example, the `handlePrevious` and `handleNext` functions handle button clicks:

    function handlePrevious() {
    if (step > 1) setStep((s) => s - 1);
    }

    function handleNext() {
    if (step < 3) {
        setStep((s) => s + 1);
    }
    }

### Dynamic Content

The `StepMessage` component dynamically displays content based on the `step` prop:

    function StepMessage({ step, children }) {
    // ...
    }

### CSS Styling

Inline styles are applied to elements using JavaScript objects:

    <button style={{ backgroundColor: bgcolor, color: color }} onClick={onClick}>
    {children}
    </button>

### React Hooks and Component Reusability

This project uses React hooks like `useState` to manage state and side effects. Additionally, component reusability is demonstrated with components like `StepMessage` and `Button`.
